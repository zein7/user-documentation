4. Scroll down to add the new user to different workgroups and administration authorities where
   their roles withing the workgroups and administration authorities can be assigned

   click the option at the bottom of the page (save a continue editing) which will open a new page with a 
   message at the top saying that a new user has successfully been created

   new user can add this information later
   
7. Permissions can now be added, by selecting (staff status) the new user will have access to administration information, 
   and by selecting (superuser status) the new user can fully control all the information within the registry
   
8. Once all the permissions are set, creating a new user is done and the user can now edit their own information
